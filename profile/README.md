<h2>Purpose of SnapTimer</h2>
<p>SnapTimer is a minimalist countdown timer for Windows that helps users track time intervals, manage work sessions, breaks or any timed tasks. Because it is portable and lightweight, the program is ideal for people who need a quick timer without installing heavy software.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simple, clean interface - start a timer by typing minutes and pressing Enter.</li>
  <li>Countdown or stopwatch mode (if minutes set to 0, it acts as stopwatch).</li>
  <li>Multiple alert types: message box pop-up, tray icon notification, custom audio alarm or even launch an application.</li>
  <li>Optional ticking sound while countdown runs.</li>
  <li>Pause, restart, reset functionality.</li>
  <li>Can stay on top of other windows.</li>
  <li>Portable - no installation required, runs from USB or any folder.</li>
  <li>Low memory and resource usage - ideal for older or modest systems.</li>
  <li>Option for automatic restart of timer when countdown finishes.</li>
  <li>Ability to run multiple instances (with some setting tweaks) if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Advantages</h2>
<p>Unlike many feature-heavy timer or productivity applications, SnapTimer emphasizes simplicity and immediate usability. You don't need to navigate menus - just type a number and start. Its portability, minimal system requirements, absence of installation, and support for different types of alerts make it a reliable "set-and-forget" companion tool. Because it can run from a USB drive, you can carry it between computers.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>SnapTimer is perfect for anyone needing a quick and simple timer: students managing study sessions, professionals working with Pomodoro-style intervals, people needing reminders for breaks, or anyone wanting a lightweight stopwatch/timer without bloat. It is also useful for people working on different computers - since it's portable, it can run without installation.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using SnapTimer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fast startup and immediate usability - no time wasted. </li>
  <li>No installation - no registry changes, making it safe and clean.</li>
  <li>Very small footprint (few megabytes), so it doesn't burden system performance.</li>
  <li>Flexible alert and alarm options, including audio, pop-up, or custom application launch.</li>
  <li>Can serve both as simple countdown timer and stopwatch - versatile usage.</li>
  <li>Portable - runs from USB flash drives or external storage without installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules / How SnapTimer Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Timer Engine</strong> - controls countdown or stopwatch logic, triggers alerts when time is up.</li>
  <li><strong>Alert System</strong> - supports multiple alert types (message box, tray notification, audio, run external app) selected by user.</li>
  <li><strong>Interface Layer</strong> - minimal GUI and tray icon, with ability to start/pause/reset via mouse or keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable Storage & Settings Module</strong> - writes settings to local .ini or config file (no registry), enabling running from USB or external drives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>SnapTimer supports all modern Windows versions including Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because the application is very small (about 1.5 MB compressed) and does not require installation, hardware requirements are minimal - any typical PC capable of running Windows will handle it.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simplistic interface - there is no advanced scheduling, task management or integration with calendars. SnapTimer is strictly a basic timer.</li>
  <li>No synchronization across devices, no cloud backup or remote alerts - because it is local and offline.</li>
  <li>Development appears to have stopped - latest official version is 0.1, with last major distribution around 2012–2014.</li>
  <li>Interface and design are basic and may look outdated compared to modern apps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Work sessions - e.g. Pomodoro technique: set 25 or 50 minutes, then rest. </li>
  <li>Break reminders - for long study or working sessions, remind to rest or stretch. </li>
  <li>Short tasks - timing cooking, exercises, focused tasks, or any activity with a fixed duration. </li>
  <li>Stopwatch use - measure elapsed time for tasks, activities or tests. </li>
  <li>Portable use - run from USB on different machines, without installing. </li>
</ul>
